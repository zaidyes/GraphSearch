Coding Challenge : "Breadth-First-Search"
=========================================

Summary
-------

Implement optimized breadth-first-search (BFS).

Detailed Description
--------------------

The task is to implement an optimized version of breadth-first-search (BFS) as
part of a deterministic graph processing application.

- Search must be performed with the given test data.
- Implementation must use the predefined interfaces.
- The solution must be designed to run in-memory and in real-time.
- Identify the hot spots and optimize the solution for speed and
  memory consumption.
- You are allowed to add whatever you think is helpful to the predefined
  type or class definitions.

You are encouraged to really change, optimize and refactor the code to get
the best performance and lowest memory footprint!!


Acceptance Criteria
-------------------

- Delivered source code including tests.
- Delivered documentation.
- Sucessfully compiles (at least) on common Linux OR Windows environments.
- Successfully running executable, console output is provided.
- Successfully runing unit test mode with all tests passed,
  console output is provided.


Rules
-----

Allowed tools are:

- C++ 11 or C++ 14
- The C++ Standard Library
- the C Standard Library
- The C POSIX Library
- Any unit testing library (or your own quick solution)
- Any build system (while CMake or GNU Make are preferred)

NOT allowed:

- Anything else


Good luck!
